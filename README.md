I created this program for the Penn State Association of Computing Machinery Branch to use in workshops. Anyone may download, modify, and/or distribute this program without restriction. This is a learning tool, after all.

DONWLOAD INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Under the green "Code" tab, download the project as a .ZIP
2. Locate the .ZIP file on your machine and move it wherever convenient
3. Extract the .ZIP contents (use Extract All or equivalent command)
4. Enter the unzipped folder, then navigate downward through the internal folder(s) until you locate a folder named ACM_ALWorkshop
5. Move the ACM_ALWorkshop directory out from the original unzipped folder (which can then be deleted)
6. Open the Unity Hub and select "Select Project From Disk" under the "Open" tab
7. Select and import the ACM_ALWorkshop folder
8. Wait for Unity to open the project
9. Inside the Unity project, locate and select "SampleScene" from the Project Window
10. Press "Open" in the SampleScene's inspector
11. The project should now be correctly loaded and ready for tinkering!
